A Computer is a machine designed to manipulate information.
It does by:
+ Inputting
+ Storing
+ Processes and
+ Outputting information.
    + Input devices include your keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone, gps, touch pad, thermostat and many others.
    + Output devices include your monitor, speakers, printer, robotic, motors and many more.

>Computers use tiny wires which carry electrical currents. Each wire is one bit and can either be on or off, true or false, 1 or 0. These 1s and 0s make up the binary language that computers use to operate. The more bits the more complex the processes can be.

>All input is converted into numbers and then converted into binary. The modern programming languages we use today convert code readable by humans into binary readable by your computer.

>The CPU, or central processing unit, is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer. 

>The operating system is the master program that controls how the software interacts with the hardware.
