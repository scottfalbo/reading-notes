## Markdown Notes
> Markdown is a method used to organize and style a collection of text into a cohesive readable website.  It allows prioritization of material through creation of varying sized header texts, lists and blockquote.  It also allows text formatting such as creating bold and italic words.  It can be used to create links and include images on a webpage.  Markdown uses some symbols, or non-alphebetic characters, to create a short hand version of element tags saving key strokes and time.  Without the use of Markdown browsers would simply read a file and present it as an un-organized strung together wall of text.
+ Using a `#` before a line of text will apply an h1 tag increasing the size of the text and making it stand out as a section header. Using `##` will apply an h2 and so on.
+ You can create ordered and unordered lists mt typing out 1., 2., 3. for an ordered list and `*`, `-`, or `+` for an unordered list.
  + You can even put lists
  + within lists
+ If you want to draw attention to a specific word or phrase you can use `**` before and after a section of text to make it appear **bold like this**.
  * a single `*` before and after will make *the selection italicized*.
