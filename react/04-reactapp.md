# Create React App

> Create React App is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and create react app sets up the tools you need to start your React project.

1. `npm install -g create-react-app` - install packages
2.  `create-react-app app-name` - create new app
  + `npm start` - starts development server
  + `npm run build` - bundles into static files for production
  + `npm test` - starts test runner
  + `npm run eject` - removes create-react-app tool and copies files into the app directory.  There is no return once this is done.
