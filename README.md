My name is **Scott Falbo.**  I am a software developement student at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) and an artist at [Studio Arcanum](http://studioarcanum.com/) in Seattle, WA.  
I live with my wife Amber who is also a student at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), and our four cats.  When I'm not studying code or doing art stuff I enjoy watching cartoons and have been a long time player of the Diablo and Warcraft franchises.  
I was always interested in computers at a young age.  As a kid I enjoyed taking apart and rebuilding machines to learn the hardware components.  In high school and college I dabbled with some programming classes including HTML, Java and C++.  I also learned a language called Hypercard on Mac a million years ago but I'm pretty sure it was a dead language even at the time.  
I'm excited to really get into programming as an adult and to explore what this world has to offer.
