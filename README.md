#  Scott's Reading Notes 

### Growth Mindset

> **Growth mindset** is the belief that you can learn to do anything you want.  it is embracing challenges to help yourself grow and realizing that failure is an oppurtunity to learn.  it is trying new things and viewing criticism as constructive feedback.  It also means being inspired by the success of others and building on that knowledge.

>> 1. Be able to look at a challenge from different perspectives outside of my own to find new modalities and processes.
>> 2. No one starts out knowing anything and failure should be embraced as a learning experience.
>> 3. Learning is not a competition and I should not be intemidated by other's success.

My name is **Scott Falbo.**  I am a software developement student at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) and an artist at [Studio Arcanum](http://studioarcanum.com/) in Seattle, WA.  
I live with my wife Amber who is also a student at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), and our four cats.  When I'm not studying code or doing art stuff I enjoy watching cartoons and have been a long time player of the Diablo and Warcraft franchises.  
I was always interested in computers at a young age.  As a kid I enjoyed taking apart and rebuilding machines to learn the hardware components.  In high school and college I dabbled with some programming classes including HTML, Java and C++.  I also learned a lauguage called Hypercard on Mac a million years ago but I'm pretty sure it was a dead language even at the time.  
I'm excited to really get into programming as an adult and to explore what this world has to offer.
