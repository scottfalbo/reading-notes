# Scott's Reading Notes

## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
*Chapter 1c*

+ HTML: Content layer.  Structure and Semantics.
+ CSS: Presentation layer.  Colors, fonts, borders, etc.
+ JavaScript: Behavoior Layer.  Adds interactivity.

These three layers form a popular basis for web design called **Progressive Enhancement**.

The `script` tag is used to tell HTML to add JavaScript.  Most `scripts` are including just before the `</body>` tag.

`script src="file.js"></script>`

### Objects and Methods

`document.write('Hello');` = `object.method(parameter);`

> **Objects** have several **methods** and **properties**.  These are known as **members** of that object.  You access the members with a `.` between the object and member you want to access.  The `.` is called a **member operator**.

- `document` represents the entire page.  All browsers implement this object.

- The `write()` method allows content to be written to the screen where the `<script>` element lives.
