## Rest

+ Web servers send documentation across the internet.
+ http is a protocol that can describe the location of anything in the world from anywhere in the world.
+ URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept
+ In most cases, a resource has only a single representation, but might be used more as more formats pop up.
+ Web Services and APIs use the same protocols to send messages back and forth from machine to machine.
+ The machines use the URL to tell each other where things are.  If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun.
+ Different languages, databases and systems have different ways of looking at nouns.  The URL is important because it tells them about each others nouns.
+ **Polymorphism** is the concept that different nouns can have the sames verbs applied to them.
+ Some verbs are basically universal like, `get`, `put`, and `delete`
