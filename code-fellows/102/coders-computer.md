## The Coder's Computer Notes

#### Text Editor

> A text editor a is a program that you install or access on line to edit text for code.  There are many different programs out there and like most things one size does not fit all.  Each editor may have it's own unique set of features that appeal to different types of users and coding styles.  **Visual Studio Code** is a great example of a text editor that already has all of the tools and add ons built in a ready to go.
Some important features to look for are:
+ **Code Completion.**
  + Code complition will auto complete and often times create a set of closing brackets automatically greatly cutting down on keystrokes and time.
+ **Syntax Highlighting**
  + Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read and organize by colorizing text and tags based on their attributes.
+ **Themes**
  + You can setup themes in text editors as well.  A theme is a specific preset of background and element colors set by the user to their preference.

The difference between a text editor and an IDE (Intergrated Developement Environment) is that the IDE is several tools in one.  An IDE includes a text editor, file manager, debugger and compiler all in one.  

#### The Terminal

> The terminal, or CLI (Command Line Interface), is a way of accessing and manipulating files on your machine without using a front end GUI, not unlike the DOS prompts of yore.  GUI is short for Graphical User Interface and refers to the interactable programs and applications you use to navigate your computer.
>> **Terminal Tasks**
>> + Finding files or file content
>> + Changing directories
>> + Move and copy files
>> + Open files
>> + Make new files and folders

**Abstraction** is when a programmer hides all but the required data from the user to make a more friendly experience.  I think if it like baking a cake.  You add ingredients to a mixer and you know what the mixer will do.  You don't need to know how the mechanism inside the mixer works or how the wiring in the building brings power to the mixer to use it.

#### Terminal Commands
+ `cd`: change directory
+ `ls`: list
+ `pwd`: print working directory
+ `touch`: create file
+ `rm -rf filename`: delete file.  *BE CAREFUL, DOUBLE CHECK SPELLING*
+ `mkdir`: create a directory
+ `cd ..`: go back a directory
+ `cd ../../../`: go back three directories

#### Flags
- `ls -a`: flag all, shows hidden
- `ls -la`

#### Git Commands
- `git clone http:/url`: clone repository from git
- ACP: add, commit, push
  + `git add filename`
  + `git commit -m "notes"`
  + `git push origin master`
- `git status`: see the status of your files
