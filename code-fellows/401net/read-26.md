+ Model: Represents the objects in the app.
+ View: The front end UI.
+ Controller: Handles the requests between the view and the model.

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a responsive framework for building front ends.  It is designed for mobile first and includes break points, menus, button and a bunch of other pre-wired stuff.  This is useful if you need a quick front end to test a server, or if you want a good starting point to build a custom front end.

The framework is built a 12 column grid.  It has a bunch of built in classes for easy formatting.
