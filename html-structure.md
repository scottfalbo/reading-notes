# Scott's Reading Notes

### Structure web pages with HTML

#### Process and Design
+ Understand your target audience.  Why would they visit your site, what information do they want/need and how often the will revisit.
+ Creating a **site map** lets you plan the over all structure of the site.
+ A **wireframe**, or rough site sketch, is used to organize the layout and content of each page.
+ Design is about communication.  Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand the information on the site.
    + Size, color and style are all ways to differentiate between information or sections and groups of information.
