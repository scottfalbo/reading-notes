# Scott's Reading Notes

### Structure web pages with HTML

#### Process and Design
*Chapter 18*

+ Understand your target audience.  Why would they visit your site, what information do they want/need and how often the will revisit.
+ Creating a **site map** lets you plan the over all structure of the site.
+ A **wireframe**, or rough site sketch, is used to organize the layout and content of each page.
+ Design is about communication.  Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand the information on the site.
    + Size, color and style are all ways to differentiate between information or sections and groups of information.

#### Structure
*Chapter 1*

+ HTML pages are text documents that use tags to give information.
+ **Tags** are often refered to as **elements** and usually come in pairs of opening and closing. `<html></html>` or `<p></p>` are examples of open and closing tags.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes which can affect how the element will appear in the browser.
    + `<img src="imagename.png" alt="alt text" width="200">`
    + In the above line of code *alt* and *width* are both **attributes** of the `<img src>` **element** or **tag** and the information contained within each is a **value**.
