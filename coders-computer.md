#### Text Editor

> A text editor a is a program that you install or access on line to edit text for code.  There are many different programs out there and like most things one size does not fit all.  Each editor may have it's own unique set of features that appeal to different types of users and coding styles.
Some important features to look for are:
+ **Code Completion.**

+ **Syntax Highlighting**
  + Syntax highlighting makes code easier to read and organize by colorizing text and tags based on their attributes.
