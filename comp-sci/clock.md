# System Clock, *(RTC) Real Time Clock*

The system clock is small microchip, which contains a quartz crystal, located on the motherboard.  It's purpose is to regulate the timing and speed of all computer functions.


It achieves this by sending out a signal on a regular basis to all other computer components ensuring they stay synchronized.  This signal is send by the quartz acting as an oscillator.

Processor speed is measured in clock speed.
+ `1 MHz` is one million cycles, or vibrations per second.
+ `1 GHz` is one billion cycles, or vibrations per second.

Clock speeds are set above the longest time that any signal needs to travel through the circuit board.  This prevents signals from arriving before others are ready, keeping everything synchronized.
