# Revisions and the Cloud

#### VCS

> **Version Control System (VCS)** is a system that allows to revisist previous instances of a file and groups of files.  This is useful for reverting files to previous states, tracking modifcation and comparing changes.
>> + *Local Version Control*: A database on your hard disk that stores changed files.
>> + *Centralized Version Control (CVCS)*: A single server that stores all changes and file version that can be accessed by multiple clients.  This is crucial in collaborative work as team members can see and track what others are doing and leaders have more control over the scope.
>> + *Distributed Version Control (DVCS)*: Building on CVCS distributed version control allows clients to create mirrored repositories that act as data backups to replace any lost information in the event of hardware issues or corruption.
