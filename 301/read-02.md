  + perform tasks
  + handle events

## Paired Programming 
[paired programming article](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

> Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

> Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

> There are four fundamental skills that help in learning a new language. Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful idea.
 > + Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
  + Greater efficiency
  + Engaged collaboration
  + Learning from fellow students
  + Social skills
  + Job interview readiness
  + Work environment readiness
