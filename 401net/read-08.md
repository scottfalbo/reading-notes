# 401 .NET Read 08: Collections

## Collections
[Microsoft Docs: Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/collections)<br>

A collection is a way of grouping and storing objects in a dynamic manner.  A collection can grow and shrink in size and some collection types allow assigning of a key for easier navigation.

Lists are the most common collection type.  Just like an array values can be initialized on creation, and we can loop through it just like an array.  But we get some more here like indexes and the ability to add and remove things.

## Enums
[Microsoft Docs: Enumeration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum)<br>

Enumeration types are basically custom value types that you get to define the underlying integral values.  By default the values are just like an index but can be assigned.  The types and their integral values can then be accessed for use.

Enums can have nested types which really gives us the chance to build some super deep and unique value types, this is pretty neat, confusing, but neat.

<hr>

The biggest advantage to these value, and collection,  types is the ability to scale and search them easily.  Which we can do with numerous built in and custom methods.
