[article](https://hamre-erik.medium.com/deliberate-practice-the-fastest-way-to-improve-your-skills-c98c32521dee)<br>
+ Deliberate practice pushes you to try things just beyond your current abilities.  It is best to focus on specific goals as opposed to some vague over all improvement.  
+ **Four criteria to be considered deliberate practice**
  1. Motivated to attend to the task, exert effort and improve.
  2. Take into account previous knowledge, the task should be at an appropriate level of difficulty.
  3. Receive immediate informative feedback.
  4. Repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks.
+ *The real goal isn't practice, it's progress, never mistake mere activity for accomplishment*
+ Improve a little bit every day for a long time, 
+ Repeat what you already know but do it better.
+ Ask yourself questions.
