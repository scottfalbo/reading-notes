# 401 .NET Read 17: Razer Pages
[Microsoft docs: Intro to Razer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio)<br>

Razer Pages is a page-focused approach built on top of MVC.  It works by integrating with controllers and views and allows for customization of conventions.
          
Razer is designed for server side web applications.  If you are returning html that is going to the browser use razer.  If it's an api or has no html return it should go in a regular MVC controller.

Razer seems similar to React in that each page has it's own state, logic and updatable props.  Everything lives in a Pages folder.  And each route has a view template and accompanying .cs file.
