# 401 .NET Read 05: Linked Lists

Linked lists are data structures similar to arrays.  However unlike an array that is static, Linked Lists are dynamic, which means they can change in length as we manipulate them.

Linked lists are dynamic because, as opposed to an array that requires *(n)* continuously connected spaces in memory, the items, or `nodes` in a link list can be scattered in memory relying on pointers to find the next.

Each `node` hold the `data`, the `next` node, and if it's a doubly, the `previous` node.

+ **Advantages**
  + Dynamic
  + Easy insertion and deletion
+ **Disadvantages**
  + No index, must transverse to search


So a Linked List would be best for raw storage and organization, while an array is better for searchability.
